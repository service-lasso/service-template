# service-template

_Status: starter template repo_

`service-template` is the canonical starting point for new Service Lasso service repos.

Use this repo when you want to create a new service repo that already has:
- the expected service repo layout
- a starter `service.json`
- starter packaging scripts
- starter verify scripts and harness contract shape
- starter docs for service contract, packaging, and validation
- starter CI scaffolding

## Use this template

Recommended flow:

1. Create a new repo from this GitHub template.
2. Rename the sample service files/content for the real service.
3. Replace the sample runtime payload with the real service payload.
4. Update `service.json`, `verify/service-harness.json`, and the docs for the new service.
5. Run the local package + test flow.
6. Wire the repo into the real released `service-lasso-harness` binary once that integration path is enabled.

## Quick start

### Local package

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\scripts\package.ps1
```

### Local tests

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File .\scripts\test.ps1
```

## Purpose

This repo is the canonical starting point for Service Lasso service repos.

Its role is to define:
- one-service-per-repo expectations
- service repo layout
- service author documentation expectations
- sample service expectations
- packaging/release expectations
- validation-harness integration expectations

## Current status

This repo is usable now as a starter template.

It currently includes:
- actual starter repo files (`service.json`, `verify/`, `scripts/`, `runtime/`, `config/`, `.github/workflows/`)
- a packaged first-pass sample artifact at `dist/echo-service-win32.zip`
- a starter multi-OS GitHub Actions workflow that packages release archives and runs basic tests
- starter harness-contract files and thin verify wrappers
- supporting reference/spec docs for deeper design work

Important current validation note:
- the pipeline does **not** yet invoke the released `service-lasso-harness` binary
- it still runs the starter local package/test flow
- switching the template pipeline to the real harness binary remains a follow-up step once the harness integration path is finalized
